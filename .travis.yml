# This script instructs the Travis CI service to build rig_cpp_key_allocation against various
# versions of Python on both Linux and Mac OS X and also deploys binary and
# source distributions of rig_cpp_key_allocation to PyPI when testing a tag.
#
# Under Linux, the googletest based test suite is executed under Valgrind to
# check for correct behaviour and lack of memory-leaks. This is not possible
# under Mac OS at present due to difficulties installing test dependencies on
# Travis' OS X image.
#
# On both Linux and OS X the module is compiled and a short Python test is run.
#
# If a Git tag is being tested, this is assumed to be for a new release of
# rig_cpp_key_allocation and so, after testing, a source distribution and
# "binary wheel" containing the compiled code is created and then uploaded to
# PyPI. Since binary wheels cannot currently be created for Linux, this process
# is only carried out on OS X. Note that though all OS X tests will attempt to
# upload a source distribution, only the first deployed will be kept. This is
# not a problem since the source distribution is identical across all
# platforms.
